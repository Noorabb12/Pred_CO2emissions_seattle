# Pred_CO2emissions_seattle
To achieve the goal of a carbon-neutral city in 2050, the city of Seattle is paying close attention to emissions from non-residential buildings.  Careful surveys were carried out in 2015 and 2016.
 However, these surveys are expensive to obtain, and from those already carried out, we must try to predict the CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of buildings for which they have not yet been measured.
In this first part, we will carry out a short exploratory analysis after cleaning the data if necessary. The goal will be to determine the relevant variables or to create new ones (feature engineering).
